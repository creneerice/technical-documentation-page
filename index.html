      <p>Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. This additional genetic material alters the course of development and causes the characteristics associated with the syndrome. It is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the United States, affecting approximately 1 in 700 babies born.</p><code></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="causes">
      <header><i>Causes</i></header>
      <p>The extra chromosome results from an error in cell division during the formation of the egg or sperm, leading to three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This can happen in several ways:</p>
      <p><code></code>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trisomy 21</strong>: The most common form, where every cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 (about 95% of cases).</li>
          <li><strong>Mosaic Down syndrom</strong>: A rare form where some cells have an extra chromosome while others do not, leading to a milder expression of the syndrome.</li>
          <li><strong>Translocation Down syndrome</strong>: Occurs when a part of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another chromosome.</li></ul></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="symptoms">
      <header><i>Symptoms</i></header>
      <p>Individuals with Down syndrome may exhibit a range of physical and developmental characteristics, including:</p><code></code>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Distinctive facial features such as a flat nasal bridge, upward slanting eyelids, and a small mouth</li>
          <li>Short stature and a stocky build</li>
          <li>Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and joint laxity</li>
          <li>Developmental delays, particularly in speech and motor skills</li>
          <li>Mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, with mental abilities often comparable to those of an 8- or 9-year-old in adulthood</li>
        </p><code></code>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="diagnosis">
      <header><i>Diagnosis</i></header>
      <p>Down syndrome diagnosis involves a combination of screening tests during pregnancy and diagnostic tests that confirm the presence of the condition. Screening tests can tell you how likely it is that your baby will have Down syndrome, while diagnostic tests confirm the presence of the condition.</p>
      <p><strong>Screening Tests:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blood test</strong> - The blood tests (or serum screening tests) measure quantities of various substances in the blood of the mother, including alpha-fetoprotein, inhibin A, plasma protein A,estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin. Typically offered in the first and second trimesters, maternal serum screening tests are only able to predict about 80 percent of fetuses with Down syndrome.</li>
        <li><strong>Ultrasound</strong> - These blood tests are often performed in conjunction with a detailed sonogram (ultrasound) to check for “markers” (characteristics that some researchers feel may have a significant association with Down syndrome).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests:</strong></p>
      <p>The diagnostic procedures available for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. These procedures, which carry up to a 1% risk of causing a spontaneous termination (miscarriage), are nearly 100% accurate in diagnosing Down syndrome. Amniocentesis is usually performed in the second trimester between 15 and 22 weeks of gestation, CVS in the first trimester between 9 and 14 weeks. Amniocentesis and CVS are also able to distinguish between these genetic types of Down syndrome: trisomy 21, translocation Down syndrome, and mosaic Down syndrome.
      </p><code></code>
      <p><strong>Post-Natal Diagnosis:</strong></p>
      <p>Once the baby is born, not all babies with Down syndrome have the typical characteristics, and many of these features can be found, to some extent, in individuals who do not have the condition. Therefore, doctors must perform a special test called a karyotype before making a definitive diagnosis.  To obtain a karyotype, doctors draw a blood sample to examine the baby's cells. They photograph the chromosomes and then group them by size, number, and shape. By examining the karyotype, they can determine accurately whether or not the baby has Down syndrome.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="treatment">
      <header><i>Treatment</i></header>
      <p>There is no single treatment for Down syndrome; instead, a combination of early intervention, medical care, and educational support is essential to improve quality of life and functional abilities.</p>
      <p>A child with Down syndrome likely will receive care from a team of health professionals, including, but not limited to, physicians, special educators, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and social workers. All professionals who interact with children with Down syndrome should provide stimulation and encouragement.</p>
      <p>People with Down syndrome are at a greater risk for a number of health problems and conditions than are people who do not have Down syndrome. Many of these associated conditions may require immediate care right after birth, occasional treatment throughout childhood and adolescence, or long-term treatments throughout life. For example, an infant with Down syndrome may need surgery a few days after birth to correct a heart defect, or a person with Down syndrome may have digestive problems that require a lifelong special diet.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Treatments:</strong></p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Intervention and Educational Therapy</strong> - “Early intervention” refers to a range of specialized programs and resources that professionals provide to very young children with Down syndrome and their families. These professionals may include special educators, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and social workers. Research indicates that early intervention improves outcomes for children with Down syndrome. This assistance can begin shortly after birth and often continues until a child reaches age 3. After that age, most children receive interventions and treatment through their local school district.</li>
        <li><strong>Treatment Therapies</strong> - A variety of therapies can be used in early intervention programs and throughout a person's life to promote the greatest possible development, independence, and productivity. Some of these therapies include:
        <ol>
          <li>Physical Therapy</li>
          <li>Speech and Language Therapy</li>  
          <li>Occupational Therapy</li>
          <li>Emotional and Behavioral Therapies</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="prognosis">
      <header><i>Prognosis</i></header>
      <p>The prognosis for individuals with Down syndrome has significantly improved, with an average life expectancy of about 60 years, and many living into their 70s and 80s due to advancements in medical care and social support. The single greatest medical factor driving the historical improvement in lifespan is the advancement and accessibility of surgical repair for congenital heart defects. Approximately 50% of infants with Down Syndrome are born with a heart defect, most commonly an Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD). In the past, these conditions were often fatal in infancy or early childhood.</p>
      <p> The standardization of pediatric cardiac surgery in the latter half of the 20th century allowed for successful repair of these defects, eliminating the primary cause of early mortality. Following this, the widespread use of antibiotics and improved general infection control significantly reduced deaths from respiratory illnesses. Individuals with Down Syndrome often have a unique immune system profile, making them more susceptible to severe respiratory infections.</p>
      <p>The implementation of robust early intervention programs and systematic health screenings also played a substantial role. Regular monitoring for conditions like thyroid dysfunction, vision problems, and hearing loss allows for prompt treatment, preventing secondary health complications. Furthermore, the shift away from institutionalized care toward family and community-based living provided better nutrition, hygiene, and immediate access to necessary medical attention, profoundly affecting health outcomes.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="quality_of_life">
      <header><i>Quality of Life</i></header>
      <p>Life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has increased dramatically in recent decades - from 25 in 1983 to 60 today. People with Down syndrome attend school, work, participate in decisions that affect them, have meaningful relationships, vote, and contribute to society in many wonderful ways. All people with Down syndrome experience cognitive delays, but the effect is usually mild to moderate and is not indicative of the many strengths and talents that each individual possesses.</p>
      <p>People with Down syndrome socialize and have meaningful friendships. Some choose to date, maintain ongoing relationships, and marry. Businesses employ adults with Down syndrome for a variety of positions - in banks, corporations, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, offices and restaurants. They work in the music and entertainment industry, in clerical positions, childcare, the sports field and the computer industry, to name a few. Like anybody else, people with Down syndrome want to have a job where their work will be valued. Quality educational programs, a stimulating home environment, good health care, and positive support from family, friends, and the community enable people with Down syndrome to lead fulfilling and productive lives.</p>
